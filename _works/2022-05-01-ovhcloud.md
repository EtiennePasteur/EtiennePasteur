At OVHCloud, I joined the "Website team" to help on the migration of the whole code base from old Javascript & Jquery to Typescript. Then I moved to "Order's team" where I ensured the migration of the old orders funnels of OVH products to Vue.js

Key metrics:
- Migration of 90% of the existing code base to Typescript
- Increased of the code coverage by more than 30%.
- Migration of 5 orders funnels (NAS-HA / NUTANIX / IPLB etc.)
