As a full stack developer, I was responsible for creating dynamic and responsive websites for customers, creating RESTful APIs, optimizing SEO, implementing Google Analytics, and designing MySQL databases. I was able to use my technical expertise to
create solutions that meet the customer's needs and ensure a smooth and successful web experience.
