As a NodeJS consultant for Stormshield, I worked on the Stormshield Data Security for Google Workspace project, which allows secure encryption of information stored in Google Spaces.
The advantages of this solution are the following:
- Data protection in SaaS mode
- Preservation of the user experience
- No agents to deploy
- Same authentication as your Google Workspace
- Can be used with an IAM or IDP
- End-to-end protection of sensitive data
- Protective keys under the sole control of the company
- Support for software and/or hardware key generators
- KMIP protocol
