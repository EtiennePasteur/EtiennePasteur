I was tasked with the exciting job of developing and designing an autonomous underwater drone. I took part for the hardware prototyping, including waterproofing, underwater communication, motors, and more. I was also actively involved in the
development of an OpenCV module that allowed the drone to track a diver in motion with a camera. This was a unique and challenging opportunity that required creativity and technical skill. Our work had a lasting impact on the underwater drone
industry, and we were at the forefront of innovation in this field.
