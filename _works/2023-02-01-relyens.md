I joined the "Healthcare Professionals Platform" team at Relyens as a frontend Angular developer. I created several sales funnels enabling healthcare professionals in France and Spain to subscribe a professional liability insurance 100% online, along with a customer space for managing their contracts, claims, replacement requests, etc.

To ensure consistency across various applications developed within Relyens, I also implemented a design system in collaboration with the UI/UX teams. Using Angular Elements and Storybook, I created around fifteen reusable web components, usable both natively and through Angular.
